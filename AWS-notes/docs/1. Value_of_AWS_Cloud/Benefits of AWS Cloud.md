3. **Cost Savings Through Economies of Scale**: AWS leverages economies of scale, spreading infrastructure costs across a vast user base. As a result, you benefit from cost-effective solutions without the need for large upfront capital investments.

4. **No Upfront Costs for Data Center Maintenance**: AWS removes the burden of managing physical data centers. You can focus on your applications and services without worrying about IT infrastructure, as AWS takes care of the maintenance.

5. **Operational Expenses Over Capital Expenses**: AWS follows an operational expenditure (OpEx) model, enabling you to pay for resources and services as you use them. This eliminates the need for substantial upfront capital expenditures (CapEx), making financial planning more predictable.

6. **Elastic Capacity**: AWS offers flexible, pay-as-you-go capacity. There's no need to guess your capacity requirements in advance. You can scale resources up or down as needed, ensuring efficient resource utilization. [[Meeting Non-Functional Requirements in the Public Cloud#^dd6fea|AWS Elastic Capacity Details]]
