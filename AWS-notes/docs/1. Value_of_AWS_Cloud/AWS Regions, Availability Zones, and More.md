# AWS Regions, Availability Zones, and More

Amazon EC2 operates in multiple global locations, each with distinct components:

1. [[Regions]]: A region represents a separate geographic area, ensuring redundancy and disaster recovery. Regions are fully independent, with varying services and resources.

2. [[Availability Zone (AZ)]]: An AZ comprises one or more data centers with redundant power, networking, and connectivity. These zones provide high availability and fault tolerance. It is within a [[Regions|region.]]

3. **Data Center**: Data centers are the building blocks of [[Availability Zone (AZ)|AZs]] and come with robust physical and environmental protections.

4. [[Local Zones]]: Local Zones extend an [[Regions|AWS Region]] to geographic proximity, serving users with low-latency communication. They are ideal for latency-sensitive applications.

5. [[Wavelength Zones]]: Wavelength Zones are isolated zones within a carrier location, providing low-latency access for specific applications.

6. [[Global Edge Network]]: Amazon CloudFront enhances performance and reliability with an extensive network of edge locations, ensuring fast content delivery.
