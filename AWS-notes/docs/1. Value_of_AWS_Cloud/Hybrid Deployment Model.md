# Hybrid Deployment Model

A hybrid deployment is a way to connect infrastructure and applications between cloud-based resources and existing resources that are not located in the cloud.

The most common method of hybrid deployment is between the cloud and existing on-premises infrastructure to extend, and grow, an organization's infrastructure into the cloud while connecting cloud resources to internal system.

## Benefits

### Accelerate digital transformation

- Bring cloud infrastructure and services where you need them to help your digital transformation projects get up and running faster.
- Modernize and manage all your applications with AWS, even those running in specific locations due to data residency, local processing, and latency requirements.  
### Improve IT and developer productivity

- Watch productivity go up and costs go down. 
- Provide developers with a common platform for building, deploying, and managing applications and give IT the same services, and tools for operating infrastructure on AWS, on premises, at the edge, and on other clouds.  
### Deliver differentiated services and experiences

- Enable interactive and responsive applications and deliver new, unique offerings to users faster.
- Deploy your applications, infrastructure, and services on premises, near large metro centers, and at the edge of 5G networks so they are closer to your end-users.

## Use cases

### Support low-latency applications

- Meet single-digit millisecond latency requirements for manufacturing automation, content creation, real-time gaming, financial trading platforms, augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR), autonomous vehicles, and inference at the edge.
- Put cloud infrastructure and services in physical proximity to where applications and end users are located, such as datacenters, large metro centers, and the mobile network edge.  
### Process data locally

- Handle the enormous amount of data generated in your digital transformation initiatives on AWS and locally.
- Build a consistent hybrid architecture that includes data sets that must remain on premises due to cost, size, bandwidth, or timing constraints. 
- Easily move data to the cloud for archiving.  
### Meet data residency requirements

- Store data in a specific country, state, or municipality to meet security and tax regulatory requirements, data sovereignty regulations, and changing geo-political dynamics.
- Use the same services and tools to manage, analyze, and archive that data wherever it resides.  
### Extend your data center

- Meet data center extension needs, including use cases such as cloud bursting, hybrid data processing, backup, and disaster recovery.
- Choose from a broad portfolio of services designed to make it as seamless as possible to run your on premises networking, security, storage, and access control infrastructure alongside AWS.  
### Move enterprise applications to the cloud

- Migrate enterprise application workloads suited for the cloud while keeping other components on premises.
- Use the proven AWS approach to deploy a few (or a few thousand) applications to the cloud rapidly while ensuring continued operation with your on premises investments.
