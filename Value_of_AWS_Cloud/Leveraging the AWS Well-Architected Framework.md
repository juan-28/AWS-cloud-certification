1. **Operational Excellence**: Plan for failure, deploy smaller reversible changes, script infrastructure as code, and continuously learn from failures. Utilize tools like AWS CodeCommit for versioning.

2. **Security**: Automate security tasks, encrypt data in transit and at rest, follow the principle of least privilege, track and audit actions, and ensure security across all layers. Utilize AWS CloudTrail for comprehensive logging.

3. **Reliability**: Automatically recover from failures, scale horizontally for resilience, avoid guessing capacity needs, automate change management, and test recovery procedures. Consider multi-AZ deployments for high availability.

4. **Performance Efficiency**: Opt for serverless architectures, explore multi-region deployments, delegate tasks to cloud vendors, and experiment with virtual resources. AWS Lambda is an excellent choice for serverless workloads. 

5. **Cost Optimization**: Implement consumption-based pricing, adopt Cloud Financial Management, measure overall efficiency, and pay only for the resources your applications require. Utilize features like S3 Intelligent Tiering for cost-effective data management.

6. **Sustainability**: Understand your environmental impact, set sustainability goals, maximize resource utilization, leverage managed services, and reduce downstream impact. EC2 Auto-scaling can help optimize resource usage.
